# 15-Puzzle-Game

This is a program that mimics the puzzle game "15".  This puzzle game is created by randomly scrambling 15 numbers 
and putting them into a random order. To complete the game, the user must reorganize the numbers back into
numerical order. This program can be ran either in the terminal or in a GUI window that was implemented 
using Tkinter from OpenCV. The GUI window allows the player to interact with each individual number tile 
and be able to move them when pressed.
